# Description

This project required me to use the MVC model to build a "Eat the Burger" Application. In this app I used models, handlebars, an express server, and a MySQL database. The application allows users to choose a burger to devour it. When the burger is eaten it will be moved the devour section, from there the user will no longer be able to choose it to be devoured. A user may also add a burger they wish to consume by entering the burger name in the input block and clicking the submit button. Once they submit their entry a new burger will be added to the devourable burgers section of the page.
